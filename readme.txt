Axem - AutoHotkey Script Manager
--------------------------------
An utility to manage a set of Autohotkey scripts and test them.

FEATURES
* When you start the script it discovers a list of .ahk scripts in a userdefinable (saved) directory.
* Double clicking on tray will present a simple form with each script listed on its own line with a checkbox on the left.
* The user can then enable and disable scripts from that dialog by checking boxes.
* Scripts that are enabled will be launched if not currently running; scripts unchecked will be closed.
* There's a contextmenu to edit, compile, and publish your AHK scripts!
* Checks will be shown for scripts that are currently running.
* It uses the correct script editor, with notepad as an alternative.

HOW TO USE IT
Point Axem to a folder containing autohotkey scripts. A list with all scripts found will come up.
You can double click or check a script to run it. Doubleclick again or uncheck a script to stop it.
Right click a script for additional options such as editing, compiling or running a publishing batch file.

TROUBLESHOOTING
* If you have any problems, delete the settings file in the installation folder.
